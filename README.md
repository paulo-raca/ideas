Ideas for next projects.

Many of them are somehow related.

Most of them will never happen :D

# Biometrics

We've been here before :)

## Scanner

Current scanners just dump a bitmap. There is no cryptographic guarantee for the image source.

- Support for (optional) live view, finger detection
- All events should be signed by the device's own private key, which itself is part of an attestation chain.
- Events should also contain a timestamp and an application-provided nonce, to ensure it was generated in the current session.
- tflite might be used to perform on-device detection (just using the average image value was a bit crappy)
- If possible, support on-device extraction/matching
- Also Accessible wirelessly (wifi/BT) ?

## New SDK

- Must be [compatible with WebAssembly!](https://web.dev/porting-libusb-to-webusb/)
- Use tflite for best performance on image operations


# [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/download/)
- A pretty/portable/expandable library that implements FIDO
  - Usable from fruit-Pi, arduinos, etc.
  - Compatible with Bluetooth, NFC, HID
- Create a fingerprint-enabled U2F device?

## [Phone-based authenticator](https://github.com/paulo-raca/android-fido-authenticator)

After a while it became clear that having a separate trinket for FIDO is impratical. They are expensive-ish, most people don't have them and they are usually limited to a minimalistic interface and a small number of resident keys (Necessary for 1-factor authentication)

In the meantime, phones are on everybody's pockets and already contain all the hardware necessary. These should be first class authenticators!

There are some steps in this direction, with Chrome already supporting using devices as authenticators -- However this is a chrome-only thing, UI could be better, and phones don't yet actually behave as NFC/Bluetooth authenticators.

Also, it would be very desirable to sync the FIDO keys between devices, so that I don't lose access to all the things whenever I replace my phones (This did happen to me with a SoloKeys device ðŸ˜–. I think this is what the whole Passkeys thing is about?

Finally, on Android FIDO is implemented by GMS (Probably a terrible idea?). While it supports NFC/BLE/HID/Platform authenticators, it seems impossible to support my own software authenticator running locally.

## Physical access

While FIDO is great for web/app authentication and has been making great strides in this front, I'm mostly concerned on physical access:

- Carrying keys is annoying,
- Most RFID tags are insecure (Just a number that can be readily copied with proper equipment)
- Biometrics has a number of issues (False positives, false negatives, _quality_ capture equipment is often expensive)

Tapping a FIDO key over NFC reader on the door knob or padlock would be pratical, cheap and secure (And that would fit perfectly with using a phone for authentication).

This could be achieved nicely using FIDO2 resident keys.

BLE would be suitable for Garage doors and cars. In the future, BLE direction-finding could be used to make everything even more secure (e.g., can only unlock within an specific area)

> [CCC Digital Key](https://carconnectivity.org/digital-key/) does that, but for cars.

# [Automatically provision Let's Encrypt SSL certificate in Python](https://github.com/paulo-raca/asgi-acme) 

The whole certificate provisioning thing is boring and painful, even with the great tooling that Let's Encrypt/ACME gave us.

Ideally, in a zero-effort SSL provisioning, things would happen like this:
- A new SSL connection is opened
- The hostname is provided in the SNI
- If we don't yet have a certificate for this hostname, hold this connection and provision on asynchronously
  - Make a certificate request on Let's encrypt
  - Perform an ACME challenge with alpn (So that we don't rely on other layers of the server)
  - Fetch the signed certificate from Let's encrypt
  - Resume the initial connection
- Use the certificate from the cache

I've looked into it and it is mostly possible. However, in python SSL doesn't provide an alpn callback (necessary for the ACME challenge), and, most importantly,
the SNI callback is not async, and therefore cannot be paused until the certificate is generated asynchronously.

# Reverse Proxy
- Like ngrok or [serveo](https://serveo.net/)
- Implemented with [asyncssh](https://asyncssh.readthedocs.io) and [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/)
- servers created via `SSH -R`, like serveo
- Clients can access over different protocols:
  - HTTP/HTTPs, with one subdomain per client (Only for HTTP services, duh)
  - Randomly allocated ports for TCP services (specific subdomain/port number can be available on IPv6)
  - WebSockets (For TCP services) that tunnel the raw TCP traffic
  - SSH using port forwarding (`ssh -L`)
- Security -- Optionally, configure so that:
  - HTTP server can only be accessed after passing through Password/Oauth gate
  - TCP can only be accessed via `ssh -L`, using the same certificate
  - Maybe implement IP whitelist/blacklist
- Support for clusters:
  - Stores mapping of tunnels in shared storage and forward between servers
- Custom domain:
  - Configured via DNS SVC, like serveo
- Paying customers:
  - Identified via their SSH certificate
  - Get their own IP address/CNAME, which can be used on their custom domains
  - TCP servers are now bound to customer IP and receive the requested number
- Will have to have strong DNS integration

# Protobuf
The generated stubs kinda sucks -- Just like the thrift ones did until [nifty](https://github.com/facebookarchive/nifty)/[swift](https://github.com/facebookarchive/swift)/[drift](https://github.com/airlift/drift).

A better stub generator should be created, based on annotations and reflection.

# Scuba
- Scuba-like tool to visualize aggregated data.
- Maybe Integrated with CRUD / Kibana / Keen.io, etc

# Automation

## PyLC
A micropython/asyncio-based runtime for PLC, based on events and dataflow.

TODO: Details

# QUIC

## aiohttp

aiohttp should support HTTP/3

## SSH v3

An essential feature of SSH is creating multiple tunnels for various subsystems, TCP channels, etc.
QUIC provides an ideal transport for that.

While we are at it:
[ ] AsyncSSH support
[ ] VHost support
[ ] UDP / VPN tunnel support

> Someone else is on it: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bider-ssh-quic/

## Datagrams
QUIC gives us all the guarantees of TCP and more, which is awesome, but maybe I could get <and more> without the TCP?

Would it make sense to support lossy datagram transports as part of QUIC?

# ML

## Banco de dados de Features
- Encontrar / criar uma estrutura de dados / banco de dados para features de alta dimensionalidade, capaz de:
  - Listar N elementos mais prÃ³ximos / elementos dentro de um raio
  - Usar distÃ¢ncias de minkowski e Mahalanobis
  - [R*_tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R*_tree)? [SR-Tree](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/20b5/fc20821968a2e990183ee4613c591951597c.pdf)? [Hybrid-Tree](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hybrid_tree.pdf)? [Review of different spatial trees](http://cs.ou.edu/~database/documents/bg98a.pdf)
- Ideia:
  - Montar uma BSP com todos os dados, 
 Â - Durante a recuperaÃ§Ã£o, em um nÃ³ nÃ£o-folha, estimar a distancia minima do ponto buscado atÃ© cada nÃ³ filho
 Â - O nÃ³ nÃ£o-folha itera dados de todos os nÃ³s filhos fazendo merge ordenado pela distancia
 Â - Os nÃ³s-filhos sÃ£o acessados por ordem de distancia, o filho mais distante sÃ³ sera acessado quando minDist(N) < dist(proximo)
 Â - yield do python Ã© Ã³timo para isso :D
  - Mesmo problema, soluÃ§Ã£o terrivel: https://substantial.com/blog/2015/01/06/feature-vector-distance-postgres/

## Neural Networks
- Rotational Convolutions
- Regression which returns stddev
- While trainning networks for Siamese/Tripplet classifiers, train it to also calculate a FAR and FRR
- Stochastic gradient for crazy nonlinear functions
- Recurrent neural network where instead of having a bazzilion cells and/or truncating the sequence, you propagate the gradients from previous iterations.

# Android

## Maybe open source:
- DeviceFarm-cli
  - Give another try on using SSH tunnels to access device's ADB
- HiddenAPI
- merged-Jars

## Logcat
Write a CLI that replaces logcat, adding:
- Package name, Process name, user name
- Filterable by package, user name, user id, process name, PID, TID, tag, message, Regex or wildcard
- Uses colors to group messages from same user/package/process/thread
- Also backup logs on ELK stack?

## Containers
- Use Android's multiuser support for implementing containers
- A special permission lets an app act as a container manager, which can:
  - Manage virtual users (Which internally are just 'regular' android users, but only visible to this app)
  - Manage apps for tne virtual users
  - Launch apps as the virtual user
  - Instrument those apps to provide hooking
  - Requires forking Android :(
- Actually, that's very similar to [Managed Profiles](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/managed-profiles)
  - It should be possible to have many Managed Profiles per user (Seems to be possible, but not supported by the frontend app that handles the "CreateManagedProfile Intent")
  - It should be possible (With a explicit user permission) to inject code into the process before the app starts up
  
  ## Testing
  - Fix AndroidJUnitRunner to be more "JUnit-y" -- That is, I want to be able to use RPC to implement a JUnit Runner on a process that executes within the Android test process. This should make it possible to create good test integration --  better than the current crapy integration with Android Studion and definitely better than AWS's DeviceFarm
    JUnit5 sounds perfect
